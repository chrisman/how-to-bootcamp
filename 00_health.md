## Mental and Physical Health

You're going to be spending a lot of time sitting at your computer. This will be physically taxing in ways your body may not be used to. You'll also be undertaking prolonged periods of intense, accelerated learning and study. This will be mentally fatiguing in ways that you may not be used to.

Your new talents and skills will be of little use to you at the end if you're a broken, shambling mess. You must take steps to protect your mental and physical health.

1. Take breaks. Change your scenery. Take your elevenses, and take your afternoon tea. Close your computer and walk away for 15 - 20 minutes. For lunch, get away and go outside. Take a walk.

2. Take even more breaks. Small, ~5 minute ones throughout the day. Keep a pomodoro timer like [marinara timer](http://www.marinaratimer.com/) open in your browser to remind you to take a small break every 30 minutes or so. During your 5 minute break, stand up and stretch. Do a couple push ups.

    Note that points 1 and 2 are both suggestions to stop working on whatever you're working on for short periods of time. Seriously, you're not helping yourself by slogging away on any one thing for hours on end.

3. Warm up. Start each day with a programming warm up instead of diving back into what you were working on. My favorite was [exercism](http://exercism.io/) See also: [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [codecombat](https://codecombat.com/play).

4. Get unstuck. Don't be stuck on any one thing for more than 30 minutes. If you suddenly realize it's been 45 - 60 minutes, _stop immediately_ and ask for help. Ask classmates, teachers, slack, mentors, etc. If none of those are available, just stop and work on something else for a bit.

3. Focus. It may sound funny, but I swear putting on a pair of headphones and listening to soma.fm boosts my productivity 60%.

    This has almost nothing to do with the music itself, and almost everything to do with limiting distractions and interuptions. In _Peopleware_ the authors devote seven chapters to what makes an office effective for people who think for a living (i.e. coders) and the recurring answer is a place where you can shut the door and work quietly with no interuption. Or a place with little hideaways where you can hide out and work quietly with no interuption. That's what headphones do for me in a bootcamp environment if I can't get away in the way I want to.

3. No coding before bed. I remember during stressful projects coding right up till I couldn't stay awake any longer, and then having stressful code dreams all night, and waking up feeling unrested and even more stressed. Give yourself a 'code freeze' an hour or more before bed, and do something to clear your mind. Yoga and a cup of tea. Something to relax and calm your mind that is not related to code, and which ideally does not involve a screen.
