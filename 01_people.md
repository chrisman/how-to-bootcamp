## Get To Know People

Everybody who completes the program will have roughly the same skill level. What you can do to distance yourself from others is to start working on being able to speak and write eloquently about what you do, and to start meeting people and making connections at companies and in lines of work that interest you.

* Your classmates and TAs and instructors are big assets. Use them and talk to them. They'll be your support group during the program, and your network afterward while you're looking for a job. If your instructors haven't offered it, ask for five minutes every week to check in and ask what they think you could be doing better or differently.

* DenverDevs. Join and participate in [Denver-Devs](https://denverdevs.org/). Get to know your neighbors!
  * General conversation: join #topic-todayi to talk about and celebrate small victories and accomplishments, not necessarily code related.
  * Meet people: Join #topic-lunches to get in on lunch outings. Join #meet-n-greet to be paired up with somebody random for a coffee date.
  * Join #help-css and #help-js. You can ask questions here if you have them, and you'll feel like a champ the first time you can help somebody else with their questions.

* Meetups. Go to a meetup once a week or so. You can live off the free pizza and beer, and you'll meet people who are established in the industry, and also new people who are in the same boat as you are. In my experience, the meetup scene is very welcoming to beginners and newbies. Don't be afraid of seeming like you don't belong. It's kind of like coding: just start doing it, and then you're a coder! Just go to a meetup, and then you're someone who goes to meetups!
  A couple of especially friendly meetups I've been to:
  * [HTML5 User Group](https://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Denver-Users-Group/)
  * [DenverScript](https://www.meetup.com/DenverScript/)
  * [RefreshDenver](https://www.meetup.com/refreshdenver/) - Designers and Developers!
  * [Ember.js](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/) - Still have yet to actually _use_ Ember ever, but the community is just so awesome.

    Check out #topic-community and #topic-meetup on DenverDevs for more.

* Make a portfolio website. Github offers [free hosting](https://pages.github.com/). Buy a cheap domain to point to it. It's okay to start putting stuff in your portfolio right now. It'll chart your progress and growth.

* Consider blogging, even if just for yourself. It'll help you organize and articulate your thoughts. A 'Week In Review' post each week will help you keep track of what you know. You can roll your own with github pages + jekyll, or you can start posting on Medium.

* Reach out to people on LinkedIn. I used to cold contact whoever had the equivelant title of "VP of Tech" at companies I was interested in and ask them out for a cup of coffee. Most people were surprisingly receptive to this. Especially if you frame the conversation as "I'm new to the industry and would like to hear about what you do and how you got started, and whether you have any advice for somebody just getting started." Try to meet one person working in your field of interest each week.
