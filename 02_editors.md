## Text Editors

Learn your text editor the way that a master chef learns their knives: practice until it becomes an extension of your hands and you can use it effortlessly.

> There are three basic steps:
>
> 1. While you are editing, keep an eye out for actions you repeat and/or spend quite a bit of time on.
> 2. Find out if there is an editor command that will do this action quicker. Read the documentation, ask a friend, or look at how others do this.
> 3. Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it without thinking.

Invest in learning to type less. Learn shortcuts. Use them relentlessly and unapologetically.

If you're not using vim, your text editing could probably suck less.

I've found vim to be peerless because of its composable commands, its macros and registers, and the fact that it keeps you in the shell. That said, I've been using vim for over a decade, casually at first, and then daily as a professional, and I still once a week or so google how to do something in it. It's possible that no one person may ever learn and know all its features, but that's no reason to not learn, use, and master the parts of it that are most useful to you.

Some people like [vim-adventures], which is cute. You may be better served just typing `vimtutor` into the terminal to learn enough to get started, and then searching out books or guides as you hunger for more. I'm a big fan of Drew Neil, his book _Practical Vim_ and his [vimcasts.org]

### Atom

Bootcamps today seem to suggest starting with Atom. Mine did. And I used it for a while in order to give it a shot, and to be using the same tools as my fellow students.

I didn't use Atom that much for that long. It was slow, and I didn't feel as productive and quick when using it. But here are a few plugins I remember liking. (Go to _Settings_ and _Install_ to search for and install packages.)

* atom-beautify - fix indenting/format your file
* color-picker - quick access to a color picker
* [emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) - powerful HTML expansion
* minimap - tiny little map of your whole file
* pigmets - highlight colors in your CSS.
