## Terminal

If your editor is your chef's knives, then your terminal is the rest of your kitchen: your counter space where you do all your work, the cabinets where your ingredients are stored, and other appliances that help you prep your ingredients.

0. [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html) - replacement for Terminal.app

1. [ohmyzsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) - framework for the zsh shell. Looks pretty. If nothing else, worth it for the github plugins. Alternately, try [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).

2. [Command Line Mysteries](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery) - learn to find what you need in files/directories. (`cd`, `ls`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`)

3. [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) - after you learn to use grep, then install and start using `ag` to quickly search your project

2. [diff so fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) - makes `git diff` a little more pleasant to read.
