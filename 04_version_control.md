* [oh shit, git!](http://ohshitgit.com/) - quick bailouts "in plain english"

Random suggestion: if you've spent any amount of time messing with your config files, move them to a `~/dotfiles` directory, and then symlink them. e.g. `ln -s ~/dotfiles/gitignore ~/.gitignore`. Then you can version control those files, set up a new computer in a jiffy, and you can start snooping other people's dotfiles for clever hacks and configs.
