Learn git and github. You'll never lose any work, and will be able to collaborate with anybody, any time, any where. Including past and future versions of yourself. git allows your code to basically exist in it's own [time and relative dimension in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS).

Random suggestion: if you've spent any amount of time messing with your config files, move them to a `~/dotfiles` directory, and then symlink them. e.g. `ln -s ~/dotfiles/gitignore ~/.gitignore`. Then you can version control those files, set up a new computer in a jiffy, and you can start snooping other people's dotfiles for clever hacks and configs.
