## CSS

Naming things is hard. Pick a CSS methodology like [BEM] or [Suit] and try it out. It will at least give you a different vocabulary with which to think about and organize your project.

* [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) - practice selectors
* [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) - practice some flex display!

You'll eventually start using a pre-processer and start writting [sass], which is awesome. And you'll start using a framework like [Bootstrap] or [Foundation], both of which are probably way overkill for small, simple projects. Definitely try them because you'll want to be familiar with them, but then consider trying a more minimal framework like [skeleton] or [milligram].

__On Specificity__

Specificity is a common pitfall when starting out, but Kyle has little sympathy for that:

> Specificity is not confusing or hard to calculate. ID selectors get 100 points, class selectors get 10 points, element selectors get 1 point. The rule with the most points wins, tie-breaker is last to be declared.
