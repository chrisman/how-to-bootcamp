## Supplemental Material

Podcasts, books, blogs, and stuff. If your brain can handle it. (As if you aren't already consuming _so much_.)

### Podcasts

I tried listening to podcasts a little bit, but never really got into it, chiefly because I didn't make time for it. Nonetheless, here are some that I remember enjoying, and some that a classmate of mine recommend.

### Books

Here are some ðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š!

__Programming and Thinking__
* _The Pragmatic Programmer_ - It's on literally everybody's required reading list. I read it. It's good. You should probably read it too.
* _Learn to Program_, Chris Pine - The "intro to programming" book recommended to me as prework reading before starting gSchool.
* _How To Solve It_, Polya - How do you solve a problem when you don't know the approach, or how to start?
* _How to Measure Anything_, Hubbard

__Design__
* _Design for Hackers_, Kadavy
* _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_, Christopher Alexander - Alexander's writings transcend architecture and become treatises on design, and a kind of metaphysics unto themselves.
* _Design of Everyday Things_, Norman

__Humans__
* _Peopleware_, DeMarco & Lister. How people get things done.
* _Scrum_, Jeff Sutherland. How software is made and how teams work together.
* _Mythical Man Month_, Brooks

### Blogs

* Reddit. Maybe start with [/r/web_design](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/) and branch out to "related subreddits" in the side bar

* Medium. Follow a few tags like [design](https://medium.com/tag/design) and [web-development](https://medium.com/tag/web-development)

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Aggregator. Not a blog.
