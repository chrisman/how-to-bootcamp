# How To Bootcamp

Here are some tips and suggestions I have for how get organized and be effecient in a coding bootcamp.

## Mental and Physical Health

You're going to be spending a lot of time sitting at your computer. This will be physically taxing in ways your body may not be used to. You'll also be undertaking prolonged periods of intense, accelerated learning and study. This will be mentally fatiguing in ways that you may not be used to.

Your new talents and skills will be of little use to you at the end if you're a broken, shambling mess. You must take steps to protect your mental and physical health.

1. Change your scenery. Get away and go outside for lunch. Take a walk.

2. Take breaks. Take many small mental breaks throughout the day. Keep a pomodoro timer like [marinara timer](http://www.marinaratimer.com/) open in your browser to remind you to take a small break every 30 minutes or so.

3. Warm up. Start each day with a programming warm up instead of diving back into what you were working on. My favorite was [exercism](http://exercism.io/) See also: [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [codecombat](https://codecombat.com/play)

4. Get unstuck. Don't be stuck on any one thing for more than 30 minutes. If you suddenly realize it's been 45 - 60 minutes, _stop immediately_ and ask for help. Ask classmates, teachers, slack, mentors, etc. If none of those are available, just stop and work on something else for a bit.

3. Focus. It may sound funny, but I swear putting on a pair of headphones and listening to soma.fm boosts my productivity 60%.
  * [space station](http://somafm.com/player/#/now-playing/spacestation)
  * [secret agent](http://somafm.com/player/#/now-playing/secretagent)

    This has almost nothing to do with the music itself, and almost everything to do with limiting distractions and interuptions. In _Peopleware_ the authors devote seven chapters to what makes an office effective for people who think for a living (i.e. coders) and the recurring answer is a place where you can shut the door and work quietly with no interuption. Or a place with little hideaways where you can hide out and work quietly with no interuption. That's what headphones do for me in a bootcamp environment if I can't get away in the way I want to.

3. No coding before bed. I remember during stressful projects coding right up till I couldn't stay awake any longer, and then having stressful code dreams all night, and waking up feeling unrested and even more stressed. Give yourself a 'code freeze' an hour or more before bed, and do something to clear your mind. Yoga and a cup of tea. Something to relax and calm your mind.

## Class and People and Human Resources

* Taking notes vs. Class participation. I tried a couple note-taking methods, from paper and pen to Evernote, but eventually stopped trying to take notes altogether, and instead used my time in class actively listening, coding along with the lecture and examples, and asking questions. I found I grasped concepts better that way, and could use time outside lectures to repeat and recreate and apply those concepts in order to reinforce them.

* Your classmates and TAs and instructors are big assets. Use them and talk to them. They'll be your support group during the program, and your network afterward while you're looking for a job.

* DenverDevs. Join and participate in [Denver-Devs](https://denverdevs.org/). Get to know your neighbors!
  * General conversation: join #topic-todayi to talk about and celebrate small victories and accomplishments, not necessarily code related.
  * Meet people: Join #topic-lunches to get in on lunch outings. Join #meet-n-greet to be paired up with somebody random for a coffee date.
  * Join #help-css and #help-js. You can ask questions here if you have them, and you'll feel like a champ the first time you can help somebody else with their questions.

* Meetups. Go to a meetup once a week or so. You can live off the free pizza and beer, and you'll meet people who are established in the industry, and also new people who are in the same boat as you are. In my experience, the meetup scene is very welcoming to beginners and newbies. Don't be afraid of seeming like you don't belong. It's kind of like coding: just start doing it, and then you're a coder! Just go to a meetup, and then you're someone who goes to meetups!
  A couple of especially friendly meetups I've been to:
  * [HTML5 User Group](https://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Denver-Users-Group/)
  * [DenverScrip](https://www.meetup.com/DenverScript/)
  * [RefreshDenver](https://www.meetup.com/refreshdenver/) - Designers and Developers!
  * [Ember.js](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/) - Still have yet to actually _use_ Ember ever, but the community is just so awesome.

    Check out #topic-community and #topic-meetup on DenverDevs for more.

## Jobs and Resumes and Marketing and Networking

* Make a portfolio website. Github offers [free hosting](https://pages.github.com/). Buy a cheap domain to point to it. It's okay to start putting stuff in your portfolio right now. It'll chart your progress and growth.

* Consider blogging, even if just for yourself. It'll help you organize and articulate your thoughts. A 'Week In Review' post each week will help you keep track of what you know. You can roll your own with github pages + jekyll, or you can start posting on Medium.

* Reach out to people on LinkedIn. I used to cold contact whoever had the equivelant title of "VP of Tech" at companies I was interested in and ask them out for a cup of coffee. Most people were surprisingly receptive to this. Especially if you frame the conversation as "I'm new to the industry and would like to hear about what you do and how you got started, and whether you have any advice for somebody just getting started." Try to meet one person working in your field of interest each week.

## Text Editors

Learn your text editor in the way that a master chef learns their knives: practice until it becomes an extension of your hands and you can use it effortlessly.

> There are three basic steps:
>
> 1. While you are editing, keep an eye out for actions you repeat and/or spend quite a bit of time on.
> 2. Find out if there is an editor command that will do this action quicker. Read the documentation, ask a friend, or look at how others do this.
> 3. Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it without thinking.
>
> _[Seven habits of effective text editing](http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html)_

Invest in learning to type less. Learn shortcuts and use them relentlessly.

__vim__

>On this path effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward [text editing mastery] will protect you from the greatest fear.
>
> _Bhagavad Gita 2:40_

I've found vim to be peerless because of its composable commands, its macros and registers, and the fact that it keeps you in the shell. That said, I've been using vim for over a decade, casually and then daily as a professional, and I still once a week or so google how to do something in it. It's possible that no one person may ever learn and know all its features, but that's no reason to not learn, use, and master the parts of it that are most useful to you.

Some people like [vim-adventures], which is cute. You may be better served just typing `vimtutor` into the terminal to learn enough to get started, and then searching out books or guides as you hunger for more. I'm a big fan of Drew Neil, his book _Practical Vim_ and his [vimcasts.org]

__Atom__

Bootcamps today seem to suggest starting with Atom. Mine did. And I used it for a while in order to give it a shot, and to be using the same tools as my fellow students.

I didn't use Atom that much for that long. But here are a few plugins I remember liking. (Go to _Settings_ and _Install_ to search for and install packages.)

* atom-beautify - fix indenting/format your file
* color-picker - quick access to a color picker
* [emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) - powerful HTML expansion
* minimap - tiny little map of your whole file
* pigmets - highlight colors in your CSS.

## Terminal

If your editor is your chef's knives, then your terminal is the rest of your kitchen: your counter space where you do all your work, the cabinets where your ingredients are stored, and other appliances that help you prep your ingredients.

0. [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html) - replacement for Terminal.app

1. [ohmyzsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) - framework for the zsh shell. Looks pretty. If nothing else, worth it for the github plugins. Alternately, try [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).

2. [Command Line Mysteries](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery) - learn to find what you need in files/directories. (`cd`, `ls`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`)

3. [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) - after you learn to use grep, then install and start using `ag` to quickly search your project

2. [diff so fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) - makes `git diff` a little more pleasant to read.

## Version Control

> History is written by those with advanced git skills

> @elijahmanor

* [oh shit, git!](http://ohshitgit.com/) - quick bailouts "in plain english"
* [git-game](https://github.com/git-game/git-game) - see how much you don't actually know about git
* [git commit emoji](https://github.com/dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji)

Random suggestion: if you've spent any amount of time messing with your config files, move them to a `~/dotfiles` directory, and then symlink them. e.g. `ln -s ~/dotfiles/gitignore ~/.gitignore`. Then you can version control those files, set up a new computer in a jiffy, and you can start snooping other people's dotfiles for clever hacks and configs.

* [my dotfiles](https://github.com/chrisman/dotfiles)

## Other Tools and Programs

On tools in general, set aside up to an hour a week to do nothing but investigate and more deeply learn your tools. Learn a new keyboard shortcut for your text editor or browser, and commit to incorporating that into your workflow.

2. Learn [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).

1. [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - window management for MacOS

2. [flux](https://justgetflux.com/) - don't burn out your retinas

3. [Sip](http://sipapp.io/) - color picker

4. [screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) - for screensharing. many a late night debugging session was done over screenhero.

## CSS

Naming things is hard. Pick a CSS methodology like [BEM] or [Suit] and try it out. It will at least give you a different vocabulary with which to think about and organize your project.

Other resources:

* [rem and em](https://zellwk.com/blog/rem-vs-em/) - how to use rem and em
* [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) - practice selectors
* [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) - practice some flex display!

You'll eventually start using a pre-processer and start writting [sass], which is awesome. And you'll start using a framework like [Bootstrap] or [Foundation], both of which are probably way overkill for small, simple projects. Definitely try them because you'll want to be familiar with them, but then consider trying a more minimal framework like [skeleton] or [milligram].

[BEM]: https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/
[Suit]: https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md
[sass]: http://sass-lang.com/
[Bootstrap]: http://getbootstrap.com/
[Foundation]: http://foundation.zurb.com/
[skeleton]: http://getskeleton.com/
[milligram]: https://milligram.github.io/

__On Specificity__

Specificity is a common pitfall when starting out, but Kyle has little sympathy for that:

> Specificity is not confusing or hard to calculate. ID selectors get 100 points, class selectors get 10 points, element selectors get 1 point. The rule with the most points wins, tie-breaker is last to be declared.

## JavaScript

__Read__
* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf) - Crockford is the godfather of JavaScript. This book is short, and full of useful patterns and advice.
* [eloquent javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - read it and complete the exercises
* [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
* [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/) - functional programming to blow your mind

__Do__
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) - use a linter! ([Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/eslint))
* [exercism](http://exercism.io/) - complete coding challenges
