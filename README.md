# How To Bootcamp

Over the past year, I completed the Full Stack program at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/), and got a job as a software engineer at [Skookum](http://skookum.com/). Based on these experiences, I have compiled some tips and suggestions for how get organized and be effecient for friends who are starting the same kind of undertaking, and which I am now making available here for you, dear reader.

Corrections, suggestions or additions, and general questions are all welcome.
