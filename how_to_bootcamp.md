# How To Bootcamp

Here are some tips and suggestions I have for how get organized and be effecient in a coding bootcamp.

## Mental and Physical Health

1. Get away and go outside for lunch. Take a walk.

2. Take many small mental breaks throughout the day. Keep a pomodoro timer like [marinara timer](http://www.marinaratimer.com/) open in your browser to remind you to take a small break every 30 minutes or so.

3. Start each day with a warm up instead of diving back into what you were working on. My favorite was [exercism](http://exercism.io/)

4. Try not to ever be stuck on any one thing for more than 30 minutes. If you suddenly realize it's been 45 - 60 minutes, _stop immediately_ and ask for help. Ask classmates, teachers, slack, mentors, etc. If none of those are available, just stop and work on something else for a bit.

3. It may sound funny, but I swear putting on a pair of headphones and listening to soma.fm boosts my productivity 50%.

## Class and People and Human Resources

* Taking notes vs. Class participation. I tried a couple note-taking methods, including paper and pen and Evernote, but eventually stopped trying to take notes altogether, and instead used my time in class actively listening, coding along with the lecture and examples, and asking questions. I found I grasped concepts better that way, and could use time outside lectures to repeat and recreate and apply those concepts in order to reinforce them.

* Your classmates and TAs and instructors are big assets. Use them and talk to them. They'll be your support group during the program, and your network afterward while you're looking for a job.

* Meetups. Go to a meetup once a week or so. You can live off the free pizza and beer, and you'll meet people who are established in the industry, and also new people who are in the same boat as you are.

* Slack. Participate in Denver-Devs.

## Jobs and Resumes and Marketing and Networking

* Make a portfolio website. Github offers [free hosting](https://pages.github.com/). Buy a cheap domain to point to it. It's okay to start putting stuff in your portfolio right now. It'll chart your progress and growth.

* Consider blogging, even if just for yourself. It'll help you organize and articulate your thoughts. A 'Week In Review' post each week will help you keep track of what you know.

* Reach out to people on LinkedIn. I used to cold contact whoever had the equivelant title of "VP of Tech" at companies I was interested in and ask them out for a cup of coffee. Most people were surprisingly receptive to this. Especially if you frame the conversation as "I'm new to the industry and would like to hear about what you do and how you got started, and whether you have any advice for somebody just getting started."

## Terminal

2. [Command Line Mysteries](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery) - Learn some commandline utilities.

1. [ohmyzsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) - framework for the zsh shell. If for nothing else, worth it for the github plugins. Alternately, try [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).

2. [diff so fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) makes `git diff` a little more pleasant to read.

3. [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher). use `ag` to quickly search your project

## Other Tools and Programs

On tools in general, set aside up to an hour a week to do nothing but investigate and more deeply learn your tools. Learn a new keyboard shortcut for your text editor or browser, and commit to incorporating that into your workflow.

Learn [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).

1. [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - window management for MacOS

2. [flux](https://justgetflux.com/) - don't burn out your retinas

3. [Sip](http://sipapp.io/) - color picker

## CSS

Naming things is hard. Pick a CSS methodology like [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) and try it out. It will help you think about your project a little more modularly.
